    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Gulab Jamun</strong> is a very popular <em>Indian</em> sweet made from deep fried balls of milk based dough that are soaked in sugary syrup. It is a <em>favorite dessert</em> of ours, and we often serve it for weddings, birthdays, festivals, parties or even as a post-prandial treat.</p>

        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sooji (rava or semolina), finer variety</li>
        <li>4 green cardamoms - powdered in a mortar-pestle or ½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk or add as required</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>oil for deep frying - as required</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>1.75 cups sugar - 250 grams</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        

        <li>
            <h3>Making Dough:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take khoya (mawa or evaporated milk) in a bowl. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can also grate and then mash the khoya.</li>
                <li>Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya.</li>
                <li>There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer. As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good.</li>
                <li>The bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. They won't be smooth.</li>
                <li>Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don't knead.</li>
                <li>Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.</li>
                <li>Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        

        <li>
            <h3>Making Sugar Syrup</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.</li>
                <li>Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside. On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
       

        <li>
        <h3>Frying</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. Lower the flame and wait for a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.</li>
                <li>Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the jamun are evenly browned.</li>
                <li>Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        

        <li>
            <h3>Making Gulab Jamun</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.</li>
                <li>When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.</li>
                <li>Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size. Don't overcook as then the jamun can break.</li>
                <li>Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.</li>
                <li>Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. You can also chill them and serve them cold. Garnish with rose petals or almond slivers.</li>
            </ol>
