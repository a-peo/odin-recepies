# odin-recepies

This is my first project by using HTML assigned by The Odin Project. I'll try to use all the concepts that I have learnt and demonstrate it (formatiing, lists, using images, hypertext references, etc..). 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
